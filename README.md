This is a directory which contains all the java programs I have done as a part of my java back end training at CREDO SYSTEMS under my mentor  Sridhar Raj P 
The folder JAVA CODES contains the following content

Under L1 Assessment - (Week-1)

Program 1 - Using swtich case concept creating a program to compute simple intresest or compund intresest based on user choice.

Program 2 - Computing the sum and average of any five numbers given by the user.

Program 3 - Demonstrating how to swap two numbers with and without using temporary variable in java.

Program 4 - Using switch case concept loops and switch case to create a java program which converts Miles to Kilometers , Kilometers to Miles , Celcius to Fahrenheit and Celcius to  Fahrenheit based on user choice and each conversion is implemented using methos in java and the program exits only after the users chooses to exit
            the program.
            
Program 5 - Using switch case to compute the areas of circle,rectangle,square,triangle,parallelogram,equilateral-triangle,trapezium,rhombus based on the choice of the user.

Program 6 - Using switch case to compute the volumnes of Sphere,Cylinder,Cone,Cube,Cuboid,and Pyramid based on user choice.

Program 7 - Computing the Voltage,Current,and Resistance in java using menu/user-driven approach.

Program 8 - Computing the Speed,Distance,Time in java using menu/user-driven approach.

Under L2 Assessment - (Week-2)

Program 9 - Using if else ladder to generate the grade and pass/fail status of a student based on the mark obtained in their examination.
